# Methods and tools:

## MySQL
MySQL is a relational database management system developed double license: General Public License / Commercial License by Oracle Corporation and is considered the most popular open source database in the world.
This tool will help us to build and manage the database which will be connected to our API.

## Maven 
Maven is a Java project management and construction software tool created by Jason van Zyl of Sonatype. It is like Apache Ant (and to a lesser extent to PHP's PEAR and Perl's CPAN) in terms of function, but has a simpler configuration model build, based on an XML format.

## Springboot
Spring Boot is a light infrastructure that delete most of the work out of configuring Spring-based applications. The Spring Boot objactive is to provide a set of tools to quickly build Spring applications that are easy to configure.
This tool will be connected with the Maven jars, which will facilitate some tasks at the time of the API creating and managment.

## Hibernate
Hibernate is an object-relational mapping (ORM) tool for the Java platform that facilitates the mapping of attributes between a traditional relational database and the object model of an application, through declarative files (XML) or annotations in the beans of the entities that allow these relationships to be established.
This tool speed up the relationship between the application and our SQL database, in a way that optimizes our workflow avoiding falling into repetitive code.

## VisualStudio
Microsoft Visual Studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Windows and macOS. It supports multiple programming languages, like C ++, C #, Visual Basic .NET, F #, Java, Python, Ruby, and PHP, as well as web development environments, like ASP.NET MVC, Django, etc., along with which must be added the new online capabilities by Windows Azure in the form of the Monaco editor.
This tool will help us to develop and edit a large part of the code for the creation, both of the API with the system which will use information from the API.

# Communication, planning and monitoring processes: 

## GitHub
It is a project management and code version control system, as well as a social network platform designed for developers.
In GitHub we will upload a large part of the project development, since, being a collaborative tool and made to make constant changes, we will be able to have better productivity in terms of the management and organization of information, tasks, etc. All this through the repositories that it provide us.

## Microsoft Teams
Microsoft Teams is a unified communication and collaboration platform that combines persistent workplace chat, video meetings, file storage (including file collaboration), and application integration.
In this application we will be connecting for direct communication with the team, where we will agree on points of the organization about the tasks, requirements and other important activities.
For the meetings, a channel has been created for the team, since it is more efficient and has more options than creating a simple group chat. Meetings happen at least 2 times at week, whether we meet with our teacher or not.

## One Drive

OneDrive is a platform that allows you to store files, documents, personal material, etc., in a single space, you can also share them with other people and have access to them on any device.
One Drive will be used to make different drafts of a different nature, such as use case plans, use case diagrams, requirements, etc. And so that the whole team can see how it is being considered, as well as being able to edit and adapt it for a better optimization of the information.
