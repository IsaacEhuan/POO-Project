In the activities calendar, we work with sprints of 11 to 20 days. These sprints have a planning and review, although the calendar dates may be subject to change because of holidays or date changes.
As for the delivery dates, these are divided into two partial deliveries and a final delivery.

##### Partial deliverie 1:
The first deliverie will be focused in show an advance of the project documentation, its functional and non-functional requirments, its use case, its class diagram, etc.

##### Partial deliverie 2:
The purpose of the second delivery will be to show the corrections of the first delivery together with complementary documentation and a partial advance of the system must also be shown, that is, in this delivery it is intended to have the user interface ready that allows user interaction with the API, failing that, a web page that allows the search for information in the API.

##### New partial delivery proposal 2:
The purpose of the second delivery will be to show the corrections of the first delivery together with the complementary documentation and a partial advance of the system must also be shown, that is, in this delivery it is intended to have the part of the CRUD with which the administrator user can add , edit and delete data within the API and it is also planned to upload the database to the cloud.

##### Final delivery:
The final delivery, as its name indicates, is the delivery where the project documentation will be corrected and the delivery of the system already in operation with the pre-established requirements in its entirety.
